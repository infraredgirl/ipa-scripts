# This file contains possible workarounds that are blocking the build/install/test
# process. These are usually needed to work around current known bugs in development
# versions of dependent packages. This file is expected to change often - when a bug
# is fixed and a new version of a package is released, the workaround should be
# removed from here. If there are no known issues in the dependent packages at the
# moment, this file should contain no workarounds.
